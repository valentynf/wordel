## Game Rules

- You have 6 attempts to guess the secret 5-letter word.

- After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word:

    ðŸŸ© Green: Correct letter in the correct position.

    ðŸŸ¨ Yellow: Correct letter in the wrong position.

    â¬› Gray: Letter not in the word at all.

- Only real 5-letters English words are accepted.

- Proper nouns (names, brands, etc.) are not allowed.

- You can't reuse the same row â€” make each guess count!
